The goal of mediator is to conduct mediation analysis under the
counterfactual framework, allowing interaction between the exposure and
mediator.

## Installation

You can install `mediator` from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gerkelab/mediator")
```

## Usage

`mediator` currently implements mediation analysis for dichotomous and
count mediators and outcomes. It assumes proper modeling on the part of
the user.
