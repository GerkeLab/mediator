**Background:** Mediation analysis allows users to examine the relationship
between an exposure and outcome through an intermediate variables, the mediator
variable, which can be used to further characterize the relationship between
the exposure and outcome. The conterfactual framework of mediation analysis
provides an extension of the work by Baron and Kenny by allowing for
exposure-mediator interactions and the decomposition of the total effect into
direct and indirect effects.

Previously software for performing this type of analysis was made available as
SAS and SPSS macros by Valeri and VanderWeele, while within R, the package
`mediation` provides some of these functions but not all and uses a different
set of terminology and framework.

We have created an R package `mediator` which provides point estimates and
confidence intervals for the controlled direct effect (CDE), as well as the
natural direct and indirect effects (NDE and NIE), total effect (TE) and
proportion mediated (PM) under multiple conditions and allows, but does not
require, interaction between the exposure and mediator variables.

**Usage:** The package was developed using R v 3.6.1 and is available on github
and can be installed and brought into the environment using the following
commands `devtools::install_github("gerkelab/mediator") ; library(mediator)`.
The `mediator` package allows for binary and continuous exposures, mediators
and outcomes as well as survival outcomes.

At a minimum users need to provide the data set for the analysis (`data = `), a
model for the outcome and mediator (`out.model = ` and `med.model = `), and
specify what type of models are being used (`out.reg = ` and `med.reg = `).
Users also need to specify which variables are the treatment (`treat = `) and
mediator (`mediator = `). The package assumes proper modeling on the part of
the user. Additional options include setting the exposure level (`a =`), the
compared exposure level (`a_star = `), the level of the mediator (`m = `) and
the number of bootstrap replications for calculating the confidence interval
(`boot_rep = `). The level of the mediator is used for calculating the CDE and
thus there are as many potential values for the CDE as there are levels of the
mediator. By default the function calculates confidence intervals using the
Delta method, but by changing the number of bootstrap replicates the user
alters how the confidence interval is calculated automatically.

The function returns a tibble with the CDE, NDE, NIE, TE and their 95%
confidence intervals along with the PM. Covariates for the returned effects are
either the mean value (continuous) or the most common value (categorical).

**Example:** Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
database, we examine the effect of race on insurance status and whether it is
mediated through Yost Index, which is a census-track level composite measure of
socio-economic status indicators. When setting the mediatior level (Yost index)
equal to the median value in Caucasian and African American men, being African
American was protective against being insured and roughly the same regardless
of what Yost Index was set at (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.42, 0.47 and OR = 0.45; 95%
CI 0.43, 0.47, respectively). These results are compatible with the low
proportion mediated of 0.06.

**Conclusion:** The `mediator` R package provides an efficient mechanism for
conducting casual mediation analyses and a useful tool in reproducible
epidemiologic research.
