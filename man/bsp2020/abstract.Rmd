**Background:** A mediation analysis examines the extent to which the causal
relationship between an exposure and outcome operates through an intermediate
variable, known as a mediator. A recently developed counterfactual framing of
mediation analysis --- referred to as _causal mediation analysis_ --- extends
traditional methods by allowing exposure-mediator interactions and
appropriately decomposing the total effect into direct and indirect effects.

Current software implementations for causal mediation analysis are available as
SAS and SPSS macros by Valeri and VanderWeele. Within R, the package
`mediation` (Tingley et al.) provides a subset of similar functions, but uses a
different estimation approach and set of terminology which are less familiar to
public health researchers.

We present the R package `mediator`, which provides point estimates and
confidence intervals for statistics of interest in a causal mediation analysis.
These include the controlled direct effect (CDE), natural direct and indirect
effects (NDE and NIE), total effect (TE), and proportion mediated (PM). The
package allows the user to specify whether an interaction between the exposure
and mediator is assumed to exist.  In addition to offering the first R
implementation of causal mediation analysis as described by VanderWeele (2015),
our implementation offers substantial performance enhancements over existing
SAS/SPSS macros.

**Usage:** The package was developed using R v 3.6.1 and is currently available
on GitHub. Installation and loading is accomplished with
`devtools::install_github("gerkelab/mediator"); library(mediator)`. The
`mediator` package allows for binary and continuous exposures, mediators and
outcomes, as well as survival outcomes.

Use of the package is centered around the `mediator()` function.  Minimum
inputs for functionality include the analytic data set (`data = `), generlized
linear model specifications for the outcome and mediator (`out.model = ` and
`med.model = `), and the treatment variable (`treat = `). Additional options
include setting the exposure level (`a =`), the compared exposure level
(`a_star = `), the level of the mediator (`m = `), and the number of bootstrap
replications for calculating confidence intervals (`boot_rep = `). Fixed levels
of the mediator are used for calculating CDE, hence, there are as many
potential values for the CDE as there are levels of the mediator. By default
the function calculates parametric confidence intervals using the Delta method,
but user specification of nonzero bootstrap replicates automatically changes
the method of confidence interval estimation to bootstrap.

The function returns a tibble with the CDE, NDE, NIE, TE, and PM, along with
95% confidence intervals. Returned effects are estimated at either the mean
value (continuous) or the most common value (categorical) of covariates which
are not the mediator or exposure variables.

**Example:**  Using data on pancreatic cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we examine the effect of sex on overall survival and whether it is
mediated through smoking status. The proportion mediated is 0.09 and the 
direct effect of sex on pancreatic cancer survival is 0.80 and the indirect
effect of sex on survival through smoking is 0.98, with the combined
total effect of 0.78. The controlled direct effect of male sex compared to 
female sex when forcing smoking status as never smokers is 0.79, while 
when setting smoking status as previous or current smoker the effect of 
male sex on survival status is 0.82. 

**Conclusion:** The `mediator` R package provides an efficient mechanism for
conducting causal mediation analyses and a useful tool in reproducible
epidemiologic research.
